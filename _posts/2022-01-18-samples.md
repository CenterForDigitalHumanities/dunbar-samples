# Demonstrative Samples

These images show some of the current functionality of the Dunbar Library and Archive. 
The current state is still disjointed and under development, but the media below shows 
that there is a real ability to connect remote resources and relate them to each other.

## Books, Poems, Performances

The published books and poems of Dunbar (expandable to any textual resource) are stored 
by the DLA as independent resources and linked to supplemental resources (at eCommons in 
this example) including a dialect glossary, composers, and performances.

### TEI XML

![XML resource]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/poemXML.png)

A version of *The Collected Works* is part of the DLA as a TEI/XML file and linked in 
some interfaces.

![Poem Detail]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/poemAggregate.png)

This interface can show the details of an abstracted "poem" following the structure of 
the [FRBR](https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/frbreng.pdf) Work/Expression/Manifestation/Item 
model. Note the text, pulled from a preferenced Item, and the three versions of this poem 
currently in the collection (one in our TEI/XML above and two from eCommons).
