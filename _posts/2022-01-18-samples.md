# Demonstrative Samples

These images show some of the current functionality of the Dunbar Library and Archive. 
The current state is still disjointed and under development, but the media below shows 
that there is a real ability to connect remote resources and relate them to each other.

## Books, Poems, Performances

The published books and poems of Dunbar (expandable to any textual resource) are stored 
by the DLA as independent resources and linked to supplemental resources (at eCommons in 
this example) including a dialect glossary, composers, and performances.

### Poem Details

[![Poem Detail]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/poemAggregate.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/poemAggregate.png)

This interface can show the details of an abstracted "poem" following the structure of 
the [FRBR](https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/frbreng.pdf) Work/Expression/Manifestation/Item 
model. Note the text, pulled from a preferenced Item, and the three versions of this poem 
currently in the collection (one in our TEI/XML below and two from eCommons).

### TEI XML

[![XML resource]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/poemXML.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/poemXML.png)

A version of *The Collected Works* is part of the DLA as a TEI/XML file and linked in 
some interfaces.

### eCommons

[![eCommons resource]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/poem-eCommons.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/poem-eCommons.png)

The poem resources on eCommons have poem text and other details, including related musical 
arrangements or performances. These same resources are pointed at by the Dunbar Glossary 
on the eCommons platform.

### Manage Poems List

[![Manage Dunbar Poems List]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/managePoems.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/managePoems.png)

Shows a project manager all the poems (textual resources) included dynamically in the DLA 
and allows them to remove them, add them to a workspace, or release them to the public 
interfaces in their current state. This also creates a cached list for speedy rendering of 
long lists like the one that follows.

### Poems List

[![Dunbar Poems List]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/poemsList.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/poemsList.png)

This is the public list available to the users of the DLA platform, composed of a variety of 
remote resources, moderated by a project manager.

### Book Rendering

[![Book Rendering]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/bookRendering.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/bookRendering.png)

One of the electronic resources (in this case the TEI/XML above) is offered to the user as a 
visualization of the content with some additional functionality, called out in the following images.

### Book Text Search

[![Book Text Search]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/bookTextSearch.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/bookTextSearch.png)

In this sample, simple string matching is used to filter the rendering to lines of interest and limit 
the long text to something more digestible.

### Book Glossary Connection

[![Book Glossary Connection]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/bookGlossary.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/bookGlossary.png)

The eCommons collection "Dunbar Glossary" contains excellent resources for user to dig into difficult 
terms, presenting the user with the entry from eCommons, complete with an external link and direct 
access to the recordings on eCommons.

### eCommons Dunbar Glossary

[![eCommons Dunbar Glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/eCommonsGlossary.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/eCommonsGlossary.png)

The eCommons collection "Dunbar Glossary" contains excellent resources for user to dig into difficult 
terms, presenting the user with the entry from eCommons, complete with an external link and direct 
access to the recordings on eCommons.
